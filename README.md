<h3>You will need to Install</h3>
You will need to install https://pypi.org/project/dadjokes/ and https://zeromq.org/languages/python/ to run this code with Python on your local machine. I used Python 3.11.2 (https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run the code with two terminals in Windows 11.

<h2>Credits</h2>
This is the code from the microservice that Darren Mah created (https://github.com/darrenmah/cs361_microservice) with a couple of modifications and my individual project.
